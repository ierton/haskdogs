INFO
====

haskdogs is a small shellscript-like tool which creates tag file for entire
haskell project directory. It takes into account first-level dependencies by
recursively scanning imports and adding matching packages to the final
tag list.

As a result, programmer can use his/her text editor supporting tags (vim, for
example) to jump directly to definition of any standard or foreign function
he/she uses.

Note, that haskdogs calls some Unix shell commands like 'test' or 'mkdir'
so this tool will run, but probably fail to work on pure Windows platforms.

=======

0. cabal install hasktags
1. git clone https://github.com/ierton/haskdogs
2. cd haskdogs
3. cabal install
